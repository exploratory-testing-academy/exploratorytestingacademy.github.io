<br>
<p>Modern Exploratory Testing builds on insight that lead to naming Exploratory testing 35 years ago: 
there is a particular approach to testing that treats testing as multidisciplinary and learning-centric activity. 
While it used to be prevalent in the product companies in Silicon Valley, this approach to testing has since its 
inception been spotted in the wild globally within companies focused on results without wasted effort. </p>

<p>All good testing is exploratory to an extent, but not all testing is modern exploratory testing that centers learning. </p>

<p>This site is a teaching hub for modern exploratory testing. </p>

<h2> Exploratory Testing while Documenting with Test Automation</h2>

<p>
Exploratory Testing Academy will showcase:
<ul>
  <li>99 minute online workshops - each with a specific constraint creating session focus for learning</li>
  <li>Video and audio content on concepts and techniques</li>
  <li>optional payment on value received within the financial constraints of the student</li>
</ul>

There is no organization sponsoring the effort, it is between me and the community. <p>

The first 99 minute workshops are:
<ul>
  <li>Aug 20th: Exploratory Testing While Documenting with Test Automation
    [Tickets]</a>
  <br>
  How does exploratory testing change when while exploring, we significantly focus on
  creating systematic executable documentation? Whether you know your way around code or not,
  this session gives you an experience to build on in real life projects. We are using Robot
  Framework to explore a data-intensive domain we don't know beforehand. </li>
  <li>??: How Would You Test a Text Field?
  <br>
  This session explores a classic job interview question and shows dimensions to a seemingly
  simple question with a simple test application. What ideas do you use before you call your testing done?</li>
  <li>??: Systematic feature test ideation
  <br>
  You're given a new feature to test, how do you figure out what tasks that includes in a way that you can
  explain with your team and get their contribution too? </li>
  <li>??: Change testing
  <br>
  Looking at a series of actual code changes, this session rehearses targeting testing inspired by
  commit messages and contents. We learn to read code without reading code, and turning that into ideas of
  what we might test after the change. </li>
  <li>??: Exploring an API Java Edition</li>
  <li>??: Exploring an API Python Edition</li>
